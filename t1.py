# 1. Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of them belongs to a 
# different data type.
'''
a,b,c=1, 2.01, "string"
print(a,b,c)
'''
# 2. Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.
'''
x=1+2j
y=6

x,y=y,x
print(x)
print(y)'''

# 3. Swaping the numbers using third variable and also without using third variable

'''
a=5
b=8

temp=a
a=b
b=temp
print(a)
print(b)

x=10
y=20

x,y=y,x
print(x)
print(y)'''

#  5. Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the 2 numbers and keep the sum in another variable called z.
#Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the final output

'''x=int(input("Enter the number between 1 to 10: "))
y=int(input("Enter another number between 1 to 10: "))

z=x+y 
result=z+30
print(result)'''

# 6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.
'''
a=14.3

print(type(a))'''

# 7. Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and UPPERCASE.
'''
FirstName="Monika"
lastName="Singh"
my_address="Chicago"
COUNTRY="U.S.A"  '''

# 8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
# again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
'''
a=23
a=4.5
print(a)'''
